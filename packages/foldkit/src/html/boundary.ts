/** Per-runtime registry of Submodel wrapping descriptors. The runtime
 *  creates one of these in `start` and reuses it across renders.
 *  `h.submodel` writes into `wraps` each render and attaches a snabbdom
 *  `destroy` hook that calls `deregisterBoundaryWrap` when the
 *  corresponding vnode is removed from the DOM tree. The dispatch path
 *  reads from `wraps` at event-fire time.
 *
 *  `boundaryDispatches` caches per-(outerDispatch, boundaryId) dispatcher
 *  closures so `requireDispatch` returns a stable reference across
 *  repeated calls with the same outerDispatch (necessary for
 *  `createLazy`'s dispatch-identity check). Keyed by outerDispatch as a
 *  WeakMap so DevTools jump-to renders with a different
 *  outerDispatch (typically a noOpDispatch that drops messages) get
 *  their own per-boundary cache. Without this two-level keying, a
 *  dispatcher created during a live render would still close over the
 *  live outerDispatch after a jump-to and silently mutate the live app.
 *
 *  `seenThisRender` tracks boundaries marked alive during the current
 *  render for duplicate-slotId detection: two `h.submodel` calls
 *  inside the same parent boundary must use different `slotId`s.
 *  Values are the call site captured at register time, surfaced when a
 *  second register collides so both locations land in the throw
 *  message. The map is cleared at the start of each render via
 *  `beginRender`. Boundaries behind a `createLazy`/`createKeyedLazy`
 *  cache hit are replayed into this map via {@link markSeenForLazyHit}
 *  so the duplicate-slotId guard catches collisions against memoized
 *  siblings, not just against siblings that re-ran this frame. It does
 *  not drive pruning (VNode destroy hooks do), but the Submodel destroy
 *  hook reads it during the patch phase to tell a same-cycle remount (a
 *  keyed root whose key changed) from a true unmount, skipping
 *  deregistration in the remount case. See {@link beginRender}.
 *
 *  `lazyTrackingStack` is a stack of sets used by `createLazy` and
 *  `createKeyedLazy` to capture which boundary ids were marked alive
 *  during the wrapped function's first execution. On a later cache
 *  hit, the lazy helper replays the captured ids into
 *  `seenThisRender` so the duplicate-slotId guard sees them. Each
 *  active lazy invocation pushes its own set; `registerBoundaryWrap`
 *  and `markSeenForLazyHit` write to every set on the stack so an
 *  outer lazy correctly captures ids contributed by inner lazies it
 *  wraps. */
