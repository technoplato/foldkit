# @foldkit/oxlint-plugin

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d23b39: Add `foldkit/no-module-level-mutable-state`, a lint rule that flags module-level `let` and `var` declarations (including `export let`), which hold state outside the Model. Ambient `declare let` declarations are not flagged. Scaffolded projects enable the rule in their generated `.oxlintrc.json`.

  Ported from the purity-boundary rule family in `@mpsuesser/oxlint-plugin-foldkit` by Marc Suesser.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 86b2250: Publish the Foldkit oxlint plugin and scaffold new apps with oxlint and the Foldkit-specific lint rules.
