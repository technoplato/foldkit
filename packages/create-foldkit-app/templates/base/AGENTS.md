# Agent Development Notes

This is a Foldkit app — a framework built on Effect-TS.

If `./repos/foldkit` exists, it contains the full Foldkit repository as a git submodule. The `examples/` directory and `packages/typing-game/client/src/` in particular are the best reference for what idiomatic Foldkit apps look like.

If `./repos/foldkit` does not exist and the line below says `submodule_prompted: false`, offer to run `git submodule add https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit.git repos/foldkit` — this gives you access to the full source, examples, and docs. Whether the user accepts or declines, update the value to `true` so it isn't asked again.

submodule_prompted: false

## Project Conventions

- Foldkit is tightly coupled to the Effect ecosystem. Do not suggest solutions outside of Effect-TS.
- Model fields must be Schema types (the model is a schema). Plain TypeScript types are fine elsewhere — function return types, local variables, etc.
- Use full names like `Message` (not `Msg`), and `withReturnType` (not `as const` or type casting).
- Use `m()` for message schemas, `ts()` for other tagged structs (model states, field validation), and `r()` for route schemas.
- Never use `NoOp` as a message. Every message must carry meaning about what happened. Fire-and-forget commands use `Completed*` messages with verb-first naming that mirrors the Command name: Command `LockScroll` → Message `CompletedLockScroll`, Command `ShowDialog` → Message `CompletedShowDialog`, Command `NavigateInternal` → Message `CompletedNavigateInternal`.
- Push back on any suggested direction that violates Elm Architecture principles — unidirectional data flow, messages as facts (not commands), model as single source of truth, and side effects confined to commands. If a user or prompt suggests a pattern that breaks these conventions (e.g. mutating state directly, imperative event handlers, two-way bindings), flag the issue and propose the idiomatic Foldkit approach instead.

## Foldkit Patterns

### Update

`init` and `update` both return `[Model, ReadonlyArray<Command<Message>>]`:

```ts
type UpdateReturn = readonly [Model, ReadonlyArray<Command<Message>>]
const withUpdateReturn = M.withReturnType<UpdateReturn>()

const update = (model: Model, message: Message): UpdateReturn =>
  M.value(message).pipe(
    withUpdateReturn,
    M.tagsExhaustive({
      ClickedIncrement: () => [evo(model, { count: count => count + 1 }), []],
    }),
  )
```

### Model Updates with `evo`

Use `evo()` for immutable model updates — never spread or Object.assign:

```ts
evo(model, { isSubmitting: () => true })
evo(model, { count: count => count + 1 })
```

Don't add type annotations to `evo` callbacks when the type can be inferred.

### View

Call `html<Message>()` once in a dedicated `html.ts` file and import the destructured helpers everywhere else:

```ts
// html.ts
export const { div, button, span, Class, OnClick } = html<Message>()
```

Use `empty` (not `null`) for conditional rendering. Use `M.value().pipe(M.tagsExhaustive({...}))` for rendering discriminated unions and `Array.match` for rendering lists that may be empty.

Use `keyed` wrappers whenever the view branches into structurally different layouts based on route or model state. Without keying, the virtual DOM will try to diff one layout into another (e.g. a full-width landing page into a sidebar docs layout), which causes stale DOM, mismatched event handlers, and subtle rendering bugs. Key the outermost container of each layout branch with a stable string (e.g. `keyed('div')('landing', ...)` vs `keyed('div')('docs', ...)`). Within a single layout, key the content area on the route tag (e.g. `keyed('div')(model.route._tag, ...)`) so page transitions replace rather than patch.

### Commands

Define Command identities with `Command.define`, passing the result Message schemas after the name — result types are required. Always assign definitions to PascalCase constants — never use `Command.define` inline in a pipe chain:

```ts
const FetchWeather = Command.define(
  'FetchWeather',
  SucceededFetchWeather,
  FailedFetchWeather,
)

const fetchWeather = (city: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // ...
    return SucceededFetchWeather({ data })
  }).pipe(
    Effect.catchAll(error =>
      Effect.succeed(FailedFetchWeather({ error: String(error) })),
    ),
    FetchWeather,
  )
```

Commands catch all errors and return Messages — side effects never crash the app. Let TypeScript infer Command return types from the Effect — the result Message schemas passed to `Command.define` constrain the Effect's return type at the type level.

Command definitions live where they're produced — colocated with the update function that returns them. Don't centralize all definitions in one file.

### File Organization

Use uppercase section headers (`// MODEL`, `// MESSAGE`, `// INIT`, `// UPDATE`, `// COMMAND`, `// VIEW`) to make files easier to skim. These are for wayfinding — they make it clear where things live and where new code should go. Use domain-specific headers too when it helps (e.g. `// PHYSICS`, `// ROUTING`).

Even after extracting some sections to their own files (e.g. `message.ts`), the remaining file may still benefit from headers. Extract to separate files when it helps with organization.

### Testing

Test update functions with `foldkit/test`. Since update is pure — `(Model, Message) → [Model, Commands]` — tests run without a runtime, DOM, or side effects.

Use `Test.story` to chain steps into a readable narrative: set initial Model → send Message → assert → resolve Command → assert again. Every `Command.define` must include result Message schemas so Commands can be resolved in tests.

If the `repos/foldkit` submodule is available, study the `.test.ts` files in `repos/foldkit/examples/` for patterns — they cover simple Command resolution, multi-step interactions, and Submodel OutMessage assertions.

## Code Quality Standards

- Every name should eliminate ambiguity. Prefix Option-typed values with `maybe` (e.g. `maybeSession`). Name functions by their precise effect (e.g. `enqueueMessage` not `addMessage`). A reader should never need to check a type signature to understand what a name refers to.
- Each function should operate at a single abstraction level. Orchestrators delegate to focused helpers — they don't mix coordination with implementation. If a function reads like it's doing two things, extract one.
- Encode state in discriminated unions, not booleans or nullable fields. Use `Idle | Loading | Error | Ok` instead of `isLoading: boolean`. Make impossible states unrepresentable.
- Name messages as verb-first, past-tense events describing what happened (`SubmittedUsernameForm`, `CreatedRoom`, `PressedKey`), not imperative commands. The verb prefix acts as a category marker: `Clicked*` for button presses, `Updated*` for input changes, `Succeeded*`/`Failed*` for command results that can meaningfully fail (e.g. `SucceededFetchWeather`, `FailedFetchWeather`), `Completed*` for fire-and-forget command acknowledgments where the result is uninteresting and the update function is a no-op (e.g. `CompletedLockScroll`, `CompletedShowDialog`, `CompletedNavigateInternal`), `Got*` exclusively for receiving child module results via the OutMessage pattern (e.g. `GotProductsMessage`). Never use `NoOp` — every message must describe what happened. The update function decides what to do — messages are facts.
- Use `Option` instead of `null` or `undefined`. Match explicitly with `Option.match` or chain with `Option.map`/`Option.flatMap`. No `if (x != null)` checks. Prefer `Option.match` over `Option.map` + `Option.getOrElse` — if you're unwrapping at the end, just match.
- Prefer curried, data-last functions that compose in `pipe` chains.
- Every line should serve a purpose. No dead code, no empty catch blocks, no placeholder types, no defensive code for impossible cases.

## Code Style Conventions

### Effect-TS Patterns

- Prefer `pipe()` for multi-step data flow. Never use `pipe` with a single operation — call the function directly instead: `Option.match(value, {...})` not `pipe(value, Option.match({...}))`.
- Use `Effect.gen()` for imperative-style async operations.
- Always use Effect.Match instead of switch.
- Prefer Effect module functions over native methods when available — e.g. `Array.map`, `Array.filter`, `Option.map`, `String.startsWith` from Effect instead of their native equivalents. This includes Effect's `String` module: use `String.includes`, `String.indexOf` (returns `Option<number>`), `String.slice`, `String.startsWith`, `String.replaceAll`, `String.length`, `String.isNonEmpty`, `String.trim` etc. in `pipe` chains. Exception: native `.map`, `.filter`, `.indexOf()`, `.slice()`, etc. are fine when calling directly on a named variable — use Effect's curried, data-last forms in `pipe` chains where they compose naturally.
- Never use `for` loops or `let` for iteration. Use `Array.makeBy` for index-based construction, `Array.range` + `Array.findFirst`/`Array.findLast` for searches, and `Array.filterMap`/`Array.flatMap` for transforms.
- Never cast Schema values with `as Type`. Use callable constructors: `LoginSucceeded({ sessionId })` not `{ _tag: 'LoginSucceeded', sessionId } as Message`.
- Use `Option` for model fields that may be absent — not empty strings or zero values. `loginError: S.OptionFromSelf(S.String)` not `loginError: S.String` with `''` as the "none" state. Use `Option.match` in views to conditionally render.
- Use `Array.take` instead of `.slice(0, n)`.
- Always use `Array.isEmptyArray(foo)` instead of `foo.length === 0`. Use `Array.isNonEmptyArray(foo)` for non-empty checks. When handling both cases, prefer `Array.match`.

### Message Layout

Message definitions follow a strict layout:

```ts
const ClickedSubmit = m('ClickedSubmit')
const ChangedEmail = m('ChangedEmail', { value: S.String })
const CompletedNavigateInternal = m('CompletedNavigateInternal')

const Message = S.Union(ClickedSubmit, ChangedEmail, CompletedNavigateInternal)
type Message = typeof Message.Type
```

1. **Values** — all `m()` declarations, no blank lines between them
2. **Union + type** — `S.Union(...)` followed by `type Message = typeof Message.Type` on adjacent lines (no blank line between them)

Use `typeof ClickedSubmit` in type positions to reference a schema value's type.

### General Preferences

- Never abbreviate names. Use full, descriptive names everywhere — variables, types, functions, parameters, including callback parameters. e.g. `signature` not `sig`, `Message` not `Msg`, `(tickCount) => tickCount + 1` not `(t) => t + 1`.
- Don't suffix Command variables with `Command`. Name them by what they do: `focusButton` not `focusButtonCommand`, `scrollToItem` not `scrollToItemCommand`. The type already communicates that it's a Command. Command definitions are PascalCase (`FocusButton`, `ScrollToItem`); Command instances and factory functions are camelCase (`focusButton`, `scrollToItem`).
- Avoid `let`. Use `const` and prefer immutable patterns.
- Always use braces for control flow. `if (foo) { return true }` not `if (foo) return true`.
- Use `is*` for boolean naming e.g. `isPlaying`, `isValid`.
- Don't add inline or block comments to explain code — if code needs explanation, refactor for clarity or use better names. Exceptions: section headers (see File Organization above) and TSDoc (`/** ... */`) on public exports.
- Use capitalized string literals for Schema literal types: `S.Literal('Horizontal', 'Vertical')` not `S.Literal('horizontal', 'vertical')`.
- Capitalize namespace imports: `import * as Command from './command'` not `import * as command from './command'`.
- Extract magic numbers to named constants. No raw numeric literals in logic.
- Never use `T[]` syntax. Always use `Array<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`.
- For inline object types in `ReadonlyArray`, put `Readonly<{...}>` on the element type rather than `ReadonlyArray<{ readonly a: ...; readonly b: ... }>`. e.g. `ReadonlyArray<Readonly<{ model: Foo; toParentMessage: (m: Bar) => Baz }>>` not `ReadonlyArray<{ readonly model: Foo; readonly toParentMessage: ... }>`.
- Extract repeated inline style values (colors, shadows) to constants. Use Tailwind `@theme` for colors that map to utility classes (e.g. `--color-valentine: #ff2d55` → `text-valentine`). Use a `theme.ts` for values Tailwind can't express as utilities (textShadow, boxShadow).
