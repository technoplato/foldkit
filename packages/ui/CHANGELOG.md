## 0.113.1

## 0.113.0

### Minor Changes

- fcc7a94: Bump Effect to `4.0.0-beta.83` (from `4.0.0-beta.78`). Foldkit's peer dependencies now require `effect@4.0.0-beta.83` and `@effect/platform-browser@4.0.0-beta.83`.

  Consumers should align their Effect packages to `4.0.0-beta.83` exactly during the v4 beta window:

  ```bash
  pnpm add effect@4.0.0-beta.83 @effect/platform-browser@4.0.0-beta.83
  pnpm add -D @effect/vitest@4.0.0-beta.83
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 32fd9cb: Drop the unused `@effect/platform-browser` peer dependency from `@foldkit/ui`
  and `@foldkit/devtools`. Neither package imports it, and consumers still
  receive it transitively through `foldkit`, which does use it.

## 0.112.5

### Patch Changes

- 1684a0c: Escape element ids before using them as CSS selectors. Components that focus or
  observe their own elements (Listbox, Combobox, Menu, Popover, Dialog, DatePicker,
  Calendar, RadioGroup, Tabs, Disclosure, and animated overlays) built selectors as
  `#${id}`, which threw a `querySelector` SyntaxError when the id was not a valid CSS
  identifier on its own. Ids beginning with a digit, such as UUID-prefixed ids, now
  work.

### Minor Changes

- a481ddb: Split UI components and the in-browser DevTools overlay out of core.

  The 24 UI components move from `foldkit/ui/*` to the new `@foldkit/ui` package, and the DevTools overlay moves to the new `@foldkit/devtools` package. Breaking changes in either no longer force a core version bump.

  Migration:
  - Component usage moves to named imports from the new package: `import { Ui } from 'foldkit'` with `Ui.Button.view(...)` becomes `import { Button } from '@foldkit/ui'` with `Button.view(...)`. The `foldkit/ui/button` subpath becomes `@foldkit/ui/button`. Add `@foldkit/ui` to your dependencies. When a component name collides with another import (for example core's `Calendar`), alias it: `import { Calendar as UiCalendar } from '@foldkit/ui'`.
  - The DevTools overlay is now opt-in. `devTools: true` (or a `devTools` config object) still records history and serves the WebSocket bridge for the DevTools MCP server, but no longer mounts the in-browser panel on its own. To show the panel, install `@foldkit/devtools` and pass its overlay factory:

    ```ts
    import { overlay } from '@foldkit/devtools'

    Runtime.makeApplication({
      // ...
      devTools: { Message, overlay },
    })
    ```

  New public surface on core to support the split: the `foldkit/submodel` subpath, `foldkit/devtools-host` (the instrumentation API the overlay builds on), and `DevToolsOverlay` / `DevToolsPosition` from `foldkit/runtime`.
