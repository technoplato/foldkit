# @foldkit/vite-plugin

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 7036191: Show a helpful error when the DevTools MCP port is already in use. Previously the relay logged a generic "failed to start" line with the raw `EADDRINUSE` error, which made it hard to tell why an agent could not connect to Foldkit DevTools via MCP. The plugin now explains that another Foldkit project is likely bound to the port, and suggests either stopping that project or setting a different `devToolsMcpPort` in vite config.

  The success log was also moved into the WebSocket server's `listening` event, so "MCP relay listening on ..." no longer prints when the bind ultimately fails.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 15d77a6: Broaden the `foldkit` peer dependency from `^0.76.0` to `^0` so future foldkit minor releases don't trigger an unwanted major version cascade in dependent packages. The repo's `version-packages` script now resets these peer dep ranges back to broad form after `changeset version` runs, preventing the narrowing that was causing `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` to fire on every minor.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6426adb: Add DevTools MCP support so AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, anything that speaks MCP) can connect to a running Foldkit app. Agents read the current Model, list and inspect Message history, replay to past states, and dispatch Messages into the runtime. The runtime's own Message Schema is published as JSON Schema so the agent discovers exactly what it can dispatch, and every payload is validated against the Schema before reaching the update loop.

  ## Migration

  The `devtools` config field on `Runtime.makeProgram` is now `devTools` (capital T). Type `DevtoolsConfig` is now `DevToolsConfig`.

  ```diff
   Runtime.makeProgram({
  -  devtools: { position: 'BottomRight' },
  +  devTools: { position: 'BottomRight' },
   })
  ```

  If you import the type directly:

  ```diff
  -import type { DevtoolsConfig } from 'foldkit'
  +import type { DevToolsConfig } from 'foldkit'
  ```

  ## What's new
  - **`foldkit/devtools-protocol`** (new entry point) exposes the typed `Request`/`Response`/`Event` Schemas and a browser-side WebSocket bridge that streams DevTools store updates to the relay.
  - **`DevToolsConfig.Message`** is a new optional field. When set to your app's `Message` Schema, the runtime publishes it as JSON Schema to the agent and validates every dispatched payload against it before reaching the update loop. Without it, dispatch is rejected; the read-only tools still work.
  - **`@foldkit/vite-plugin`** accepts a new `devToolsMcpPort` option. When set, the plugin opens a WebSocket relay on that port that forwards traffic between connected browser tabs and any external MCP client. Without it, HMR behavior is unchanged. The relay only runs at dev time; production builds never include it.
  - **`@foldkit/devtools-mcp`** is a new package: an MCP server that runs as a Node child process spawned by your AI agent. Run `npx @foldkit/devtools-mcp init` in your project root to register it. See [foldkit.dev/ai/mcp](https://foldkit.dev/ai/mcp) for the full guide.
  - **`create-foldkit-app`** scaffolds new projects with `@foldkit/devtools-mcp` installed as a dev dependency, a `.mcp.json` registering the server, and a `vite.config.ts` that passes `devToolsMcpPort: 9988` to the Foldkit plugin.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 4b0a552: Adopt TypeScript 6.0 for internal tooling and migrate to Node-native ESM emit. Foldkit, `@foldkit/vite-plugin`, and `create-foldkit-app` now build and typecheck against TypeScript 6.0.2. Foldkit's internal tsconfigs moved from the deprecated `node10` resolution to `NodeNext`, and every relative import inside `packages/foldkit/src` now carries an explicit `.js` suffix. The emitted `dist/` is unchanged in shape but is now directly loadable by Node's ESM resolver — a prerequisite for future terminal/Node runtime support. Published type surfaces are unchanged; downstream projects on TypeScript 5.9+ continue to work.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 6b6895d: Skip full-reload for file changes outside the module graph (e.g. editor temp files, MCP tool logs) by checking the `modules` array before sending the reload signal.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 4b81a10: Update GitHub URL from `devinjameson/foldkit` to `foldkit/foldkit` following org transfer.
