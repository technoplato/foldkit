Stop publishing the runtime's Message Schema as JSON Schema in the DevTools wire protocol. `RuntimeInfo.maybeMessageSchema` is removed; agents discover Message shape by reading the application's source instead. Dispatch still works the same: the runtime decodes the payload against the live `Message` Schema and returns a clean error on mismatch. Only the upfront introspection hint is gone.

This avoids a class of `JSONSchema.make` failures triggered by schema constructs like `OptionFromSelf`, `instanceOf`, and other shapes without a default JSON Schema. Foldkit's UI components and `Url` use those constructs internally, so any app wrapping them via the Submodel pattern was either crashing or losing dispatch validation. The simpler protocol sidesteps the whole annotation grind.

The `Url` and `File.File` JSON Schema annotations added in the unreleased work, and the bridge's `Either.try` safety net around `JSONSchema.make`, are removed in the same change since their only purpose was to make the JSON Schema generation succeed.
